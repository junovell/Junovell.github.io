An archive of my software journey — the things I learn, break, fix, and sometimes build along the way.

This blog is where I document what works for me. It’s mostly for my future self, but if it helps someone else, that’s a bonus.

I write about (Arch) Linux, coding and sometimes dabble in security and networking.

I prefer tools that are simple, self-hostable, and open when possible. Most posts are quick write-ups or reminders, but from time to time a polished tutorial might appear.

## About AI Usage

I do use AI tools to help review and edit my writing, mainly to improve clarity and fix up my limited vocabulary. I don’t rely on it to generate content!!
